# Tank Game

## ABOUT THE GAME:

The project was made in IntelliJ IDEA 2019.3.2 with the Java version 1.8. The current working directory of the game is Start class, which is the main class that runs the game. The resources with all the images and sounds are under src/resource folder. The source codes are under tank package in src/tank folder. 

The goal of this game is to fight and kill the enemy tank. Both players drive his or her own tank using the key controls. Each tank has three lives with 300 health given for each life. Health goes down when the tank is hit by a bullet from the enemy tank. The color of health bar will change as the health decreases. 

For player one, the controls for the movement are in the keys A, S, W, D and the key "Space" is to shoot the bullet. 

For player two, the controls for the movement are in the arrow keys (top, bottom, right and left) and the key “Enter” is to shoot the bullet.

Each life destroyed by the enemy tank allows the winner player to score 1 point and the player will win once they reaches 3 points. Once the game ends, "GAME OVER" will display on the game screen.  

There are five random power ups in the game, which are the small campfires, that will give the following attributes: Damage boost by 20%, damage boost by 40%, health boost by 10% , health boost by 30% and lives count increases by 1.
