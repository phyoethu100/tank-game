About the game:

The project was made in IntelliJ IDEA with the version 1.8. Start class is the main class that runs the game. The goal of this game is to fight and kill the enemy tank. Both players drive his or her own tank using the key controls. Each tank has three lives with 300 health for each life. Health goes down when the tank is hit by a bullet from the enemy tank. There are five random power ups on in the game. 

For player one, the controls for the movement are in the keys A, S, W, D and the key "Space" is to shoot the bullet. 

For player two, the controls for the movement are in the arrow keys (top, bottom, right and left) and the key “Enter” is to shoot the bullet.

Each life destroyed by the enemy tank allows the winner player to score 1 point and the player will win once they reaches 3 points. Once the game ends, "GAME OVER" will display on the game screen.

Damage boost by 20%

Health boost by 10%
